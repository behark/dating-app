## 🛡️ Risk Assessment

### Why This Is Low Risk:

1. **Transitive Dependency:**
   - You don't directly use `inflight`
   - It's deep in the dependency tree (4-6 levels deep)
   - You can't fix it directly

2. **Local Attack Vector:**
   - Requires **internal access** to your application
   - Attacker needs to execute/influence async operations
   - Not exposed to remote users
   - **Not exploitable from the internet**

3. **Unmaintained Library:**
   - The `inflight` library itself is not maintained
   - Upstream packages (like `glob`) are working to eliminate it
   - Fix will come when dependencies update

4. **Impact:**
   - Memory leak / resource exhaustion
   - Could crash Node.js process
   - But requires local access to trigger

## ✅ Current Status

### What This Means:

- ✅ **No immediate action required**
- ✅ **Low risk** - requires local access
- ✅ **Monitoring enabled** - Snyk will alert if fix becomes available
- ⚠️ **No direct fix** - waiting for upstream updates

### What You Should Do:

1. **Monitor for Updates:**
   - Watch for `react-native` updates
   - Watch for `expo` updates
   - Watch for `glob` package updates (when it removes inflight)

2. **Check Snyk Dashboard:**
   - Snyk will notify you when a fix becomes available
   - Check dashboard monthly for updates

3. **No Code Changes Needed:**
   - This is a transitive dependency
   - You can't fix it directly
   - Just wait for upstream fixes

---

## 🔄 When Will This Be Fixed?

### Expected Timeline:

1. **Short-term:** Monitor `glob` package updates
   - `glob@7.2.3` is deprecated (glob v9+ doesn't use inflight)
   - When dependencies upgrade to glob v9+, this will be resolved

2. **Medium-term:** React Native / Expo updates
   - These packages will eventually update their dependencies
   - May take several months

3. **Long-term:** All packages eliminate inflight
   - Industry-wide effort to remove this unmaintained library
   - Eventually all packages will be updated

## 📊 Comparison with Other Vulnerabilities

| Factor             | This Vulnerability       | Typical High-Risk Issue   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Attack Vector**  | Local (internal)         | Network (remote)          |
| **Exploitability** | Requires internal access | Can be exploited remotely |
| **Direct Control** | No (transitive)          | Yes (direct dependency)   |
| **Fix Available**  | No (waiting)             | Usually yes               |
| **Risk Level**     | **Low**                  | High/Critical             |

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

- ✅ **None required** - Low risk, no fix available

### Ongoing Actions:

1. **Monitor Snyk dashboard** for updates
2. **Update dependencies regularly:**
   ```bash
   npm update react-native expo
   ```
3. **Check for glob updates** in dependency tree
4. **Review Snyk alerts** when they arrive

### When Fix Becomes Available:

1. Update `react-native` or `expo` when they release fixes
2. Run `npm audit fix` if available
3. Verify fix with `npm run snyk:test`
